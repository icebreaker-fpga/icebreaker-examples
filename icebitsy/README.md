This directory contains examples for the icebreaker-bitsy also known as icebitsy.

You are interested in the hardware, you can find the icebreaker-bitsy in the [US 1BitSquared store](https://1bitsquared.com/products/icebreaker-bitsy) as well as the [German 1BitSquared store](https://1bitsquared.de/products/icebreaker-bitsy).

## How to build and flash an example

To build the bitstream, enter the respective example directory and run:
```
make
```

To program the bitstream run:

```
make prog
```

## Notes
If you have more than one icebreaker-bitsy connected to your computer. The programming target will fail with an error indicating that `dfu-util` can not decide which device to program. To list the dfu-devices connected to your system run `dfu-util --list`. You should get an output that is similar to this:
```
‚ùØ dfu-util --list
dfu-util 0.10

By unplugging and plugging in the icebitsies as needed you should be able to figure out which one is which. When you have figured that out, you can set `DFU_SERIAL` environment variable to tell the makefile which device to program. You can either do that with each invocation of the `make prog` target:
```
make prog DFU_SERIAL=<someserialnumber>
```
or you can set the environment variable for the shell session you are using:
```
export DFU_SERIAL=<someserialnumber>
```
